# Title: NearHelper-Connecting Domestic and Agricutural Workers In Real-Time.
# Problem Statement 
Finding reliable domestic and agricultural workers can be a challenging task, especially in urban 
households and rural areas. Many workers are semi-literate or illiterate, making conventional digital 
platforms difficult to use. To bridge this gap, we propose NearHelper, a web-based platform designed to 
connect skilled workers with people who need their services quickly, easily, and efficiently. 

The primary objective of NearHelper is to simplify workforce hiring while empowering workers through 
accessible technology. The platform consists of two separate modules: 
1. Domestic Worker Module – Focused on household services such as cleaning, cooking, childcare, 
   elder care, and driving. Workers can register using voice-assisted, multi-language forms, upload 
   profiles, and set their availability. Customers can search for nearby workers based on skills, distance, 
   and real-time availability. 
2. Agricultural Worker Module – Focused on connecting farmers with skilled laborers and equipment 
   operators, including drone sprayers, harvesters, tractors, and other crop-specific tools. Workers 
   can create profiles, upload equipment photos, and set availability with expected completion time. 
   Farmers can find workers within a defined radius to ensure timely assistance. 
   NearHelper incorporates several unique features that distinguish it from existing platforms: 
- Proximity-Based Search: Quickly locate workers nearest to the user in real-time. 
- Multi-Language Support: Regional language support ensures accessibility for all users. 
- Native Voice Guidance: Voice instructions help illiterate or semi-literate users navigate the platform. 
- Profile Building with Live Location: Workers can create detailed, verified profiles with skills, 
  experience, and location. 
- Authentication and Verification: Mobile OTP and Aadhaar verification enhance trust and safety. 
- Availability Management: Workers can mark themselves busy, specifying expected completion 
  time, ensuring customers see only currently available workers. 
- Separate Modules: Distinct domestic and agricultural modules optimize search efficiency and user 
  experience. 

  By combining real-time availability, voice guidance, multi-language support, and proximity-based 
  search, NearHelper empowers workers and simplifies service access. It bridges the gap between urban 
  households, rural farmers, and the workforce, creating a reliable, inclusive, and user-friendly platform that 
  can positively impact communities across India.
